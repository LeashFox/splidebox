# splidebox
A lightbox carousel built with Splide, Alpine Js, and Tailwind CSS

Dependencies: 
- Splide (Lightweight Carousel library) - https://splidejs.com/
- Apline Js - JavaScript Framework - https://alpinejs.dev/
- Tailwind CSS - https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation

You can replace the FontAwesome SVG's with your FontAwesome script src so you can render them using <i> tags.

The splidebox can work with native Js using click/touchdown events, as long as you parse in an array of image URL's and conditionally render the images under splide__track.

I'm using dummy product object, but feel free to replace with data relevant to you, or remove it entirely.
